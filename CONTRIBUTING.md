## Opening a PR
- ### Before Opening a PR:
  - **Make sure an issue has been created on what the PR is going to address.** 
  - If no issues have been created, please create an issue first on what the PR is about, whether is it fixing a bug or adding a new feature. This helps us to track bugs/features we want to address more easily.
